    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>Dough Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Early in the day, build 100 grams of sourdough starter by feeding <b>30g starter</b> with <b>35g flour</b> and <b>35g water</b>. Allow 3-6 hours to ripen; when at least double in size, it is ready to use.</li>
        <li>Mix all dough ingredients together in large bowl. Cover, let sit for 15 minutes, and then stretch and fold the dough to form a smooth ball.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let it rise (bulk ferment) until it has almost doubled in size. May take 4-8 hours, depending on temperature of kitchen.</li>
        <li>Flour the work surface and get the dough onto it. Shape the dough into preferred shape and leave seam-side down.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest on its seam for about a minute. During this time, depending on baking method, either flour proofing vessel or prepare loaf pan with oil or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in proofing vessel seam-side up, or in loaf pan seam-side down.</li>
        <li>Cover and let dough rise for final proof.
            <ul>
                <li>For non-loaf pan with refrigeration stage: proof 30 minutes at room-temperature, then refrigerate 8-16 hours.</li>
                <li>For same-day baking or loaf pan: proof 1-2 hours at room temperature. If refrigeration stage desired for loaf pan, may then be refrigerated 8-16 hours.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Baking instructions will differ based on chosen baking vessel.</p>
    <h4>Artisan-Style Baking Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven and baking vessel at 500°F for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip dough out of proofing vessel onto sheet of parchment paper or base of hot baking vessel. Score, cover, and return vessel to oven.</li>
        <li>If baking vessel is ceramic cloche, bake at:
            <ol>
                <li>500°F for 20 minutes, lid on</li>
                <li>450°F for 5 minutes, lid on</li>
                <li>450°F for 5-10 minutes, lid off</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If baking vessel is cast iron, bake at:
            <ol>
                <li>500°F for 15 minutes lid on and then place a baking sheet under the cast iron on the same shelf</li>
                <li>450°F for 10 minutes, lid on</li>
                <li>450°F for 5-10 minutes, lid off</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>When baking is complete, the bread should have an internal temperature of at least 205°F and it should sound hollow when you knock on the bottom of the loaf.</li>
        <li>Ideally, cool for 2 hours before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Loaf Pan Baking Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375°F for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush the top of the dough with water and place it in the oven on the middle shelf.</li>
        <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes, turning the pan halfway if the bread is browning unevenly. To firm up the bottom and sides of the loaf, take it out of the loaf pan for the last 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>When baking is complete, the bread should have an internal temperature of at least 200°F.</li>
        <li>Brush the still-warm crust with butter or oil to keep it soft.</li>
        <li>Ideally, cool for 2 hours before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
