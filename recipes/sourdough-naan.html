    <h3  class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>275g all purpose flour</li>
        <li>200g sourdough starter</li>
        <li>125g milk <i>(more or less, depending on yogurt style)</i></li>
        <li>75g yogurt</li>
        <li>5g salt</li>
        <li><i>Flour for countertop</i></li>
        <li><i>Oil or butter for rolling pin</i></li>
        <li><i>Optional: Minced garlic or herbs; add to dough before rolling (Step 3), or combine with butter to brush breads once cooked</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all of the ingredients in a bowl and then hand-knead for a few minutes. Add extra flour if the dough is too sticky or more milk if it's too dry.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and let rise by 70-100%. This can take several days in the refrigerator or 4-8 hours at room temperature (or more), depending on the temperature and starter ripeness.</li>
        <li>Scrape the dough onto a floured countertop, de-gas and divide it in eight pieces. Add minced garlic and/or herbs if desired.</li>
        <li>Roll the eight pieces into balls, keeping track of order so first rolled is first fried. Wait at least 10 minutes for gluten to relax before rolling each ball flat.</li>
        <li>On stovetop, preheat cast iron pan (10 inch or larger) to "medium"; heat to be adjusted as needed.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil rolling pin; lightly flour countertop, if needed. Roll out first ball to just under 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the hot frying pan and cook each side for 1-2 minutes. Flip when the top of the dough bubbles and the sides curl under. You're aiming for brown spots - adjust heat accordingly.</li>
        <li>Place cooked naans on a rack to cool. While frying, you should have time to roll out another dough.</li>
        <li>When all naans cooked, brush with melted butter if desired. Once cooled, cover or wrap to prevent drying out.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Naans may be frozen and reheated in toaster.</p>
